= openshift4-service-mesh

`openshift4-service-mesh` is a Commodore component and configuration package to manage the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/service_mesh/v2x/ossm-about.html[OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM)].

We recommend installing the OpenShift service mesh through the provided configuration package.
The package ensures that all the operators required by OpenShift service mesh are installed into separate namespaces to minimize upgrade conflicts.
If you use the Commodore component directly, you'll have to ensure that Kiali and the distributed tracing framework (Jaeger) operators are installed yourself.

When using the configuration package, users should prefer configuring the service mesh through parameter `pkg.openshift4_service_mesh`.

See the xref:references/parameters.adoc[parameters] reference for further details.
